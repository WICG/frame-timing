        This specification defines an interface to help web developers measure the performance of their applications by giving them access to frame performance data to facilitate smoothness (i.e. Frames per Second and Time to Frame) measurements.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web developers need the ability to assess and understand the performance characteristics of their applications. While JavaScript [[ECMA-262]] provides a mechanism to approximate application Frames per Second (FPS) and Time to Frame (TTF) (by calling a nearly empty <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> [[Animation-Timing]] in a loop), the precision of this method has a high variance. Some example situations where this returns misleading results are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            CSS Animations, which can be done off of the main thread and may not impact <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrolling, which can also be handled mostly off of the main thread, and may not impact <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Slow page loading (such as extensive DOM manipulation), which may consume a lot of time on the rendering thread and allow the main thread to fire a <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> event even though the new content has not yet been displayed to the user.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This document defines the <a href="#performancerendertiming"><code>PerformanceRenderTiming</code></a> and <a href="#performancecompositetiming"><code>PerformanceCompositeTiming</code></a> interfaces, and extensions to the <a href="#extensions-performance-interface"><code>Performance</code></a> interface, which expose frame performance data to be used for smoothness measurements.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section  id="conformance">
      <p>
        Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as requirements on user agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The IDL fragments in this specification MUST be interpreted as required for conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL specification. [[!WebIDL]]

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The construction &quot;a <code>Foo</code> object&quot;, where <code>Foo</code> is actually an interface, is sometimes used instead of the more accurate &quot;an object implementing the interface Foo&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "JavaScript" is used to refer to ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]], rather than the official term ECMAScript, since the term JavaScript is more widely known.

      <h2>Monotonic Clock</h2>
      <p>
        The time values stored within the interface MUST monotonically increase to ensure they are not affected by adjustments to the system clock. The difference between any two chronologically recorded time values MUST never be negative. The user agent MUST record the system clock at the beginning of the navigation and define subsequent time values in terms of a monotonic clock measuring time elapsed from the beginning of the navigation.

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
      <p>
        The interfaces defined in this specification expose potentially sensitive timing information on specific JavaScript activity of a page. However, unlike other interfaces defined in the Performance Timeline, the interfaces defined in this specification do not have any restrictions on sharing timing information through script. This is because the web platform has been designed with the invariant that any script included on a page has the same access as any other script included on that page regardless of the origin of the script.
