    <p>This specification defines an interface for web applications to access
    runtime performance information of the browser event loop, enabling them to
    identify and fix issues that cause delayed rendering, processing of input,
    and other critical work necessary to deliver a smooth and responsive user
    experience.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In order to deliver an interactive user experience the browser
    processing model runs a [continuous event loop][] at a certain update
    frequency - e.g. 60Hz refresh rate. Each execution of the event loop is
    responsible for processing scheduled tasks (e.g. input, touch, scroll,
    etc.), associated microtasks, scheduled callbacks (e.g.
    `requestAnimationFrame`, `requestIdleCallback`), running the necessary
    rendering updates, and other necessary work.</p>

    <figure id='frame-illustration'>
      <img src="images/frame.png" alt="frame diagram">
      <figcaption>Illustration of a frame within an event loop</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If all of the work within each execution of the event loop (i.e. _within
    a "<dfn>frame</dfn>"_) is completed in allotted time budget (e.g. 16.6ms
    for 60Hz refresh rate), the browser can guarantee a smooth and responsive
    experience. However, if the work within the frame exceeds this time budget,
    for whatever reason, then one or more frames is skipped, resulting in
    inconsistent response, processing, and rendering times, which hurts the
    user experience.</p>
    <pre class="highlight example">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      // subscribe to Frame Timing notifications for slow frames
      var observer = new PerformanceObserver(function(list) {
        var perfEntries = list.getEntries();
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; perfEntries.length; i++) {
          // Process slow-frame notifications:
          // - adapt processing and rendering logic
          // - aggregate and report back for analytics and monitoring
          // - ...
          console.log("Uh oh, slow frame: ", perfEntries[i]);
        }
       });
      observer.observe({entryTypes: ['frame']});
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
    <p>The Frame Timing API enables web developers to monitor the performance
    of their applications, as experienced by their users, by observing when the
    browser is unable to deliver the desired refresh rate due to long-running
    frames that exceed the allotted time budget. By identifying such cases, and
    their cause, web developers can adapt or fix their logic to stay within the
    allotted budget and help the browser deliver an improved user
    experience.</p>

  <section  id="conformance">

    <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
    "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps")
    are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST", "SHOULD",
    "MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm. </p>

    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps MAY be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.) </p>

    <p>The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as
    required for conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL
    specification. [[!WebIDL]]</p>

      <p>This specification <strong>does not</strong> mandate any particular
      value for <dfn>time budget for the frame</dfn> that results in delivery
      of a <a>PerformanceFrameTiming</a> entry. This value is subject to user
      agent configuration and runtime factors. For example, the user agent may
      set different target update frequencies (60Hz, 30Hz, etc) and adjust this
      target at runtime based on device performance, power consumption,
      responsiveness, and other requirements.</p>
      <p>The user agent SHOULD adjust its duration thresholds to match the
      expected frame duration and update frequency to avoid reporting
      false-positives to the developer. For example, if the user agent is idle,
      it may interleave long idle callbacks (e.g. 50ms idle callback via
      [requestIdleCallback][]) and the duration threshold for slow frames
      should be adjusted accordingly to account for such frames.</p>
      <p class="issue">Explain _why_ frame is slow (in v2, probably): current
      definition reports slow frames, but there is no simple mechanism to
      determine what was the culprit (e.g. slow input handler vs. rAF vs.
      expensive paint). We may want to extend the PerformanceFrameTiming
      interface with additional attributes that capture this.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section class='informative'>
    <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
    <p>The <a>PerformanceFrameTiming</a> interface exposes timing information
    about the processing costs of the browser event loop. To limit the exposed
    information the interface is restricted to reporting slow frames only,
    which are already observable through other means (e.g.
    `requestAnimationFrame`), and the user agent is allowed to set and exercise
    own thresholds for delivery of slow frame events.</p>
